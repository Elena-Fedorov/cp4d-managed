How is my data processed and protected?\nIBM takes clients data security and protection very seriously, for additional information please see Chapter 11 Security and Compliance\n\n2. What happens when the service encounters problems?\nThrough the managed service monitoring software our IBM operations team is automatically alerted and will begin to take action and troubleshoot the service. In addition to this, on request IBM can work with Clients to setup an email distribution list for notifications of a reduced functionality or loss of service. These types of notifications would be distributed to Clients without undue delay upon confirmation of such an issue that is known or reasonably suspected by IBM to affect the Client. IBM will provide Client with reasonably requested information about such issue and the status of any IBM remediation and restoration activities.\n\n3. On which Cloud Service Provider is the service or application hosted? For example like AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.\nThis offering is only available on IBM Cloud.\n\n4. How are the environments accessed via the network?\nBy default, the servers are accessible through a Client site to site VPN on the server’s public IP addresses. These public IP addresses are utilized in order avoid conflicts with Clients internal IP private subnets.\nPublic IP’s are protected by the VPN and not accessible on the public internet.\nDNS resolution will be provided by default, which will be sufficient for a majority of customers. Alternatively, Client may setup access through their own internal DNS service.\n\n5. How can I provide ideas for improving offerings / products?\nPlease post your idea/suggestion to our IBM Analytics Ideas portal: https://ibmanalytics.ideas.aha.io/\n\n6.
