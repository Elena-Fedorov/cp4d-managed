In addition to this, on request IBM can work with Clients to setup an email distribution list for notifications of a reduced functionality or loss of service. These types of notifications would be distributed to Clients without undue delay upon confirmation of such an issue that is known or reasonably suspected by IBM to affect the Client. IBM will provide Client with reasonably requested information about such issue and the status of any IBM remediation and restoration activities.</AccordionItem>\n  <AccordionItem title=\"On which Cloud Service Provider is the service or application hosted? For example like AWS, Azure, GCP, etc?\">This offering is only available on IBM Cloud and AWS.</AccordionItem>\n  <AccordionItem title=\"How are the environments accessed via the network?\">By default, the servers are accessible through a Client site to site VPN on the server’s public IP addresses. These public IP addresses are utilized in order avoid conflicts with Clients internal IP private subnets. Public IP’s are protected by the VPN and not accessible on the public internet. DNS resolution will be provided by default, which will be sufficient for a majority of customers. Alternatively, Client may setup access through their own internal DNS service.</AccordionItem>\n  <AccordionItem title=\"How can I provide ideas for improving offerings / products?\">Please post your idea/suggestion to our IBM Analytics Ideas portal: https://ibmanalytics.ideas.aha.io/</AccordionItem>\n  <AccordionItem title=\"Where can I find additional information on IBM Data Security of the Cloud Service and privacy principals?\">Refer to the DSP https://www-03.ibm.com/software/sla/sladb.nsf/sla/dsp?OpenDocument</AccordionItem>\n  <AccordionItem title=\"How do I open a support ticket?\">Once the welcome letter is received Clients are entitled to log support cases, the designated Cloud Service Coordinator (CSC) will walk Clients through the registration and setup process.
