Cloud Service Major and Minor updates and/or patches will be evaluated for installation within a monthly maintenance window. Two weeks prior to the maintenance window, IBM will publish the list of Major and Minor updates being applied along with a brief description of the updates. During the maintenance window, the Cloud service may be unavailable.

If required, IBM will notify the Client that the Cloud Services will not be available during the maintenance window. Where possible, IBM will minimize Service disruptions for maintenance activities, with a monthly downtime goal to not exceed four (4) hours.
