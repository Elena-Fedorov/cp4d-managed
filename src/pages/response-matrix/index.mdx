description: Managed service Vs Customer Responsibility
---
The following diagram is a responsibility comparison between the managed cloud service responsibilities and traditional on-premises solution.
What is important to understand is that while the IBM managed Cloud team takes care of the majority of the cloud service, the management of the application / solution including the data is a shared responsibility.
Application wise IBM is deploying changes and performing maintenance of the application.

## IBM responsibilities include:
- Actively monitor and resolve any issues that are encountered with the cloud service.
- Maintain the software platform and the operating system, to meet security standards.
- Maintain software firewalls on servers that face the internet to provide the required protection.
- Provide user access to the cloud service once the cluster is provisioned, by sharing the web address, username, and password.
- Ensure the continuity, compatibility, and performance of the cloud service by installing only permissible software, including any open source packages, and apply patches and upgrades to the cloud service environment and operating system.
- Create and maintain regular backups of data.

## Client responsibilities include:
- Submitting problems/requests/tickets electronically through the proper support system
- Keeping issues separate (questions, problems or changes requests) and focus on one issue per ticket, incident or case
- Selecting a Severity based on your judgement of the business impact
- User testing: testing and coordination after an environment update, fix, change, development artifact, customization or extension is applied resulting from a ticket, or after scheduled maintenance.
- Providing timely feedback and keeping IBM informed, so the IBM support team can close out the issue when it has been resolved. If the issue reoccurs, or you want to request a change rollback/backout, you may reopen the original support ticket, incident or case by resubmitting it electronically.
- Coordination and communication: IBM will notify the designated contacts itâ€™s up the client for further that communication to additional users regarding usage, upcoming maintenance and outage windows.
- Troubleshooting and fix validation: working with IBM to help reproduce problems including debugging and tuning your application.
- Setup and Definition: Maintenance of all LDAP users and groups related to any application solutions
