Administrators
</PageDescription>

## First steps

1. Visit IBM Support Site Registration to register for IBM support.

2. Request the Administrator access level with the instructions at Managing Your Support Account Access. This page also helps you view the level of support access you have and make other account changes.
Note: The Administrator access level allows you to create, search, view and update all cases created by members of your account team.
Note: An administrator from your account will approve your request if you are requesting access for on-premise Software support. The IBM Support Helpdesk processes requests if there are no other account administrators registered for your account.

3. Follow the steps in Email Domain Management to set your administration preference (e.g. auto approval, auto pending or manual approval).

4. Learn to access requests: Administrator Management.

5. Refer to Case Email Notifications for instructions on configuring the email notifications you will receive about your cases.

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that
    your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you
    will see on the front-end of your site.

    - **data** this is where you’ll update your sidebar order and contents
    - **images** you can colocate your images here or store them next to your
      pages, whichver you chose
    - **gatsby-theme-carbon** this is where you’ll override (known as shadowing)
      the default `gatsby-theme-carbon` components
    - **pages** This is where most of your content will live. You’ll represent
      each page with an MDX file.

1.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not
    maintain a version history for.

1.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby
    site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata)
    like the site title and description. You’ll notice that all of the
    configuration for the site is coming from `gatsby-theme-carbon`

1.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.

1.  **`yarn.lock`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically
    generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that
    were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

1.  **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes
    things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how
    npm knows which packages to install for your project.
