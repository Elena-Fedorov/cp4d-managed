<PageDescription>

MDX allows for certain things beyond what markdown is capable of. Content here
will discuss using those features to augment or modify the default content
layout.

It's extremly important that for any rich text, or images represented through
mark down, that they are left aligned. This is true even if they are within a
component. Otherwise it will be processed as a regular string.

## FAQs
1. How is my data processed and protected?<br></br>
   IBM takes clients data security and protection very seriously, for additional information please see Chapter 11 Security and Compliance


2. What happens when the service encounters problems?<br></br>
   Through the managed service monitoring software our IBM operations team is automatically alerted and will begin to take action and troubleshoot the service. In addition to this, on request IBM can work with Clients to setup an email distribution list for notifications of a reduced functionality or loss of service. These types of notifications would be distributed to Clients without undue delay upon confirmation of such an issue that is known or reasonably suspected by IBM to affect the Client. IBM will provide Client with reasonably requested information about such issue and the status of any IBM remediation and restoration activities.


3. On which Cloud Service Provider is the service or application hosted? For example like AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.<br></br>
   This offering is only available on IBM Cloud.


4. How are the environments accessed via the network?<br></br>
   By default, the servers are accessible through a Client site to site VPN on the server’s public IP addresses. These public IP addresses are utilized in order avoid conflicts with Clients internal IP private subnets.
   Public IP’s are protected by the VPN and not accessible on the public internet.
   DNS resolution will be provided by default, which will be sufficient for a majority of customers. Alternatively, Client may setup access through their own internal DNS service.


5. How can I provide ideas for improving offerings / products?<br></br>
   Please post your idea/suggestion to our IBM Analytics Ideas portal:https://ibmanalytics.ideas.aha.io/


6. Where can I find additional information on IBM Data Security of the Cloud Service and privacy principals.<br></br>

## Frontmatter

You can declare frontmatter in your `.mdx` files to provide specific metadata
for the theme to use.

- `title`: Main page title: search results and SEO
- `description`: SEO and search results
- `date`: Enter a date that the page was last modified to be displayed at the
  bottom left corner of the page. Refer to the
  [IBM Style guide](https://www-03preprod.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ibm_style/dates-and-times.html)
  for the correct syntax.
- `keywords`: just SEO (optional)
- `hiddenFromSearch`: if true, page will be excluded from search

```md

title: Markdown
description: Usage instructions for the Markdown component
keywords: 'ibm,carbon,gatsby,mdx,markdown'
date: 27 January 2021
hiddenFromSearch: true
---
```

## Smart quotes

The theme has a remark for processing straight quotes, into 'smart' quotes ('').
However, this plugin isn't able to process text used in custom MDX components.
When using quotes in custom components, content authors should manually use
["smart quotes"](https://www.figma.com/design-systems/) to adhere to the IBM
Design Language content guidelines.

## Custom title

You can export a `Title` component in order to render a unique title for a
single page. This is particularly useful for including line breaks at a specific
location.

**Note:** You still need to provide a regular string title to the frontmatter
for search, navigation, and the HTML header title to work.

```mdx
---
title: MDX
description: custom title page
---

export const Title = () => (
  <span>
    First line <br /> Second line
  </span>
);

;
```
