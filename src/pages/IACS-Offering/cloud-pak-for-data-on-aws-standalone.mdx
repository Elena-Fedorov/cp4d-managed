## About Offering
Through IBM Expert Labs Essential Management, IBM can help run and manage the day-to-day operations of IBM software using the proven practices of our experts. IBM can provide a stable, well-performing platform to support the Client’s applications, allowing the Client to focus on their business priorities.

The Cloud Service delivers Fully Managed offerings in which IBM will provide and manage the infrastructure (network, storage, and compute resources), apply fixes to the Software, and maintain the Software, infrastructure, and applicable security and privacy controls in support of Client’s Cloud Pak for Data production and/or non-production workload.

Client must have an associated software entitlement to IBM Cloud Pak for Data with
- Sufficient entitlements to cover installation and usage
- A current entitlement to Software and Support, as a prerequisite to this service.

IBM Cloud Pak for Data software entitlements use in this Cloud Service may not be use simultaneously in other environments.
The Cloud Service includes support for the Services or Cartridges which are part of IBM Cloud Pak for Data on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with Red Hat OpenShift infrastructure.
The detailed specifications, operational description, including environment sizing parameters and quantity of entitlements required to be purchased for given environment sizes, visit the [IBM Expert Labs Essential Management for IBM Cloud Pak for Data User Guide](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6541038)

These configurations may undergo revision from time to time.
